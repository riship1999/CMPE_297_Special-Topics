# Modern AI with Unsloth.ai

This assignment demonstrates **modern fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and continued pretraining techniques** using [Unsloth.ai](https://unsloth.ai).  
It includes **five Colab notebooks**, each focusing on a different method for training and optimizing LLMs efficiently.

## 📘 Colab Notebooks Overview

### 🧩 Colab 1 – Full Fine-Tuning with Small Model  
**Description:**  
Perform **full fine-tuning** using the **smollm2-135M** model (`full_finetuning=True`).  
This notebook demonstrates end-to-end training on a chosen task (e.g., **chat** or **code generation**) using **open-weights LLMs** such as:  
- `unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it-unsloth-bnb-4bit`  
- Llama 3.1 (8B), Mistral NeMo (12B), Gemma 2 (9B), Phi-3.5 (mini), Qwen2 (7B), TinyLlama, and others  

You will explain in the video:
- How Unsloth fine-tuning works  
- Input formats and datasets used  
- Application of chat model templates

### ⚙️ Colab 2 – LoRA Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning  
**Description:**  
Repeat the same fine-tuning task as Colab 1, but with **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for parameter-efficient training.  
Only adapter weights are updated, enabling faster, memory-efficient training while achieving similar performance.

### 🧠 Colab 3 – Reinforcement Learning with Preference Data  
**Description:**  
Use a dataset containing **input**, **preferred output**, and **rejected output** pairs to perform **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** fine-tuning.  
Demonstrates how Unsloth supports preference-based learning for improving model alignment.

### 🧩 Colab 4 – Reinforcement Learning with GRPO  
**Description:**  
Train a **reasoning-capable LLM** using **GRPO (Generative Reinforcement Policy Optimization)**.  
Dataset includes problem statements, and answers are generated by the LLM itself.  
You’ll experiment with reasoning models as detailed in:

### 🌍 Colab 5 – Continued Pretraining  
**Description:**  
Perform **continued pretraining** to teach an LLM a **new language** or domain using Unsloth’s efficient pretraining framework.  
Show how model knowledge expands through incremental training.
