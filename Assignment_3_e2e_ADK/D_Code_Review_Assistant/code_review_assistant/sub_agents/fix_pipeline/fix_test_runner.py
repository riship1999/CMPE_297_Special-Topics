Fix Test Runner Agent - Validates fixes by running tests on corrected code.

THE FIXED CODE TO TEST:
```python
{code_fixes}
```

ORIGINAL TEST RESULTS: {test_execution_summary}

YOUR TASK:
1. Understand the fixes that were applied
2. Generate the same comprehensive tests (15-20 test cases) 
3. Execute the tests on the FIXED code using your code executor
4. Compare results with original test results
5. Output a detailed JSON analysis

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Run the same tests that revealed issues in the original code
- Verify that previously failing tests now pass
- Ensure no regressions were introduced
- Document the improvement

Execute your tests and output ONLY this JSON structure:
{{
    "passed": <number of tests that passed>,
    "failed": <number of tests that failed>,
    "total": <total number of tests>,
    "pass_rate": <percentage>,
    "details": [
        // Optional: specific test results if needed
    ],
    "comparison": {{
        "original_pass_rate": <from original test results>,
        "new_pass_rate": <current pass rate>,
        "improvement": <percentage point difference>,

        "still_failing_tests": [
            // List any tests still failing
        ]
    }}
