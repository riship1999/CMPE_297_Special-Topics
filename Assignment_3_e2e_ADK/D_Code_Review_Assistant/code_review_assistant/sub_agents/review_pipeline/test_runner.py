THE CODE TO TEST IS:
```python
{code_to_review}
```

YOUR TASK:
1. Understand what the function appears to do based on its name and structure
2. Generate comprehensive tests (15-20 test cases)
3. Execute the tests using your code executor
4. Analyze results to identify bugs vs expected behavior
5. Output a detailed JSON analysis

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Test with the most natural interpretation first
- When something fails, determine if it's a bug or unusual design
- Test edge cases, boundaries, and error scenarios
- Document any surprising behavior

Execute your tests and output ONLY this JSON structure:
